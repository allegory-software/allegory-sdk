## `local heap = require'heap'`

Priority queues implemented as binary heaps. A binary heap is a binary
tree that maintains the lowest (or highest) value at the root.
The tree is laid as an implicit data structure over an array.
Pushing and popping values from the heap is O(log n).
Removal is O(n) by default unless a key is reserved on the elements
(assuming they're indexable) to store the element index which makes
removal O(log n) too.

## API

| API                              | Description |
| :---                             | :---        |
| `heap.heap(...) -> push, pop`    | create a heap API from a stack API
| `heap.cdataheap(h) -> h`         | create a fixed-capacity cdata-based heap
| `heap.valueheap([h]) -> h`       | create a heap for Lua values
| `h:push(val) -> i`               | push a value
| `h:pop([i][, dst]) -> val`       | pop value (root value at default index 1)
| `h:replace(i, val)`              | replace value at index
| `h:peek([i][, dst]) -> val`      | get value without popping it
| `h:find(v) -> i`                 | find value and return its index
| `h:remove(v) -> true\|false`     | find value and remove it
| `h:length() -> n`                | number of elements in heap

__NOTE__: Values that compare equally are popped in random order.

### `heap.heap(push, pop, swap, len, cmp) -> push, pop, rebalance`

Create a heap API:

	push(v) -> i         drop a value into the heap and return its index
	pop(i)               remove the value at index i (root is at index 1)
	rebalance(i)         rebalance the heap after the value at i has been changed

from a stack API:

	push(v)              add a value to the top of the stack
	pop()                remove the value at the top of the stack
	swap(i, j)           swap two values (indices start at 1)
	len() -> n           number of elements in stack
   cmp(i, j) -> bool    compare elements

The heap can be a min-heap or max-heap depending on the comparison
function. If `cmp(i, j)` returns `a[i] < a[j]` then it's a min-heap.
Stack indices are assumed to be consecutive.

### `heap.cdataheap(h) -> h`

Create a cdata heap over table `h` which must contain:

  * `ctype`: element type (required).
  * `min_capacity`: heap starting capacity (optional, defaults to 0).
  * `cmp`: a comparison function (optional).
  * `index_key`: enables O(1) `h:find(v)` and thus O(log n) `h:remove(v)`
  at the price of setting `e[index_key]` on all elements of the heap,
  otherwise `h:find(v)` is O(n) and `h:remove(v)` is O(n).
  * `dynarray`: alternative `glue.dynarray` implementation (optional).

Note: `cdata` heaps are 1-indexed just like value heaps.

#### Example:

~~~{.lua}
local h = heap.cdataheap{
	ctype = [[
		struct {
			int priority;
			int order;
		}
	]],
	cmp = function(a, b)
		if a.priority == b.priority then
			return a.order > b.order
		end
		return a.priority < b.priority
	end}
h:push{priority = 20, order = 1}
h:push{priority = 10, order = 2}
h:push{priority = 10, order = 3}
h:push{priority = 20, order = 4}
assert(h:pop().order == 3)
assert(h:pop().order == 2)
assert(h:pop().order == 4)
assert(h:pop().order == 1)
~~~

Note: the `order` field in this example is used to stabilize
the order in which elements with the same priority are popped.

### `heap.valueheap([h]) -> h`

Create a value heap from table `h`, which can contain:

  * `cmp`: a comparison function (optional).
  * `index_key`: enables O(1) `h:find(v)` and thus O(log n) `h:remove(v)`
  at the price of setting `e[index_key]` on all elements of the heap,
  otherwise `h:find(v)` is O(n) and `h:remove(v)` is O(n).
  * a pre-allocated heap in the array part of the table (optional).

Note: trying to push `nil` into a value heap raises an error.

#### Example:

~~~{.lua}
local h = heap.valueheap{cmp = function(a, b)
		return a.priority < b.priority
	end}
h:push{priority = 20, etc = 'bar'}
h:push{priority = 10, etc = 'foo'}
assert(h:pop().priority == 10)
assert(h:pop().priority == 20)
~~~

## TODO

  * heapifying the initial array
  * merge(h), meld(h)
