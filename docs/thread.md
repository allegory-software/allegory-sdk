## `local thread = require'thread'`

Threads and threaded primitives based on [pthread] and [luastate].

| `q:peek([index]) -> true, val | false `  | peek into the list without removing (**)
| `q:free()                             `  | free queue and its resources
| __events__                               |
| `thread.event([initially_set]) -> e   `  | create an event
| `e:set()                              `  | set the flag
| `e:clear()                            `  | reset the flag
| `e:isset() -> true | false            `  | check if the flag is set
| `e:wait([timeout]) -> true | false    `  | wait until the flag is set
| `e:free()                             `  | free event

(*) the `timeout` arg is an `os.time()` or `time.time()` timestamp,
not a time period; when a timeout is passed, the function can return
`false, 'timeout'` if the specified timeout expires before the underlying
mutex is locked.

(**) default index is 1 (bottom element); negative indices count from top,
-1 being the top element; returns false if the index is out of range.

## Threads

### `thread.new(func, args...) -> th`

Create a new thread and Lua state, push `func` and `args` to the Lua state
and execute `func(args...)` in the context of the thread. The return values
of func can be retreived by calling `th:join()` (see below).

  * the function's upvalues are not copied to the Lua state along with it.
  * args can be of two kinds: copiable types and shareable types.
  * copiable types are: nils, booleans, strings, functions without upvalues,
  tables without cyclic references or multiple references to the same
  table inside.
  * shareable types are: pthread threads, mutexes, cond vars and rwlocks,
  top level Lua states, threads, queues and events.

Copiable objects are copied over to the Lua state, while shareable
objects are only shared with the thread. All args are kept from being
garbage-collected up until the thread is joined.

The returned thread object must not be discarded and `th:join()`
must be called on it to release the thread resources.

### `th:join() -> retvals...`

Wait on a thread to finish and return the return values of its worker
function. Same rules apply for copying return values as for args.
Errors are propagated to the calling thread.

## Queues

### `thread.queue([maxlength]) -> q`

Create a queue that can be safely shared and used between threads.
Elements can be popped from both ends, so it can act as both a LIFO
or a FIFO queue, as needed. When the queue is empty, attempts to
pop from it blocks until new elements are pushed again. When a
bounded queue (i.e. with maxlength) is full, attempts to push
to it blocks until elements are consumed. The order in which
multiple blocked threads wake up is arbitrary.

The queue can be locked and operated upon manually too. Use `q.mutex` to
lock/unlock it, `q.state` to access the elements (they occupy the Lua stack
starting at index 1), and `q.cond_not_empty`, `q.cond_not_full` to
wait/broadcast on the not-empty and not-full events.

Vales are transferred between states according to the rules of [luastate](luastate.md).

## Events

### `thread.event([initially_set]) -> e`

Events are a simple way to make multiple threads block on a flag.
Setting the flag unblocks any threads that are blocking on `e:wait()`.

## Programming Notes

### Threads are slow

Creating hi-level threads is slow because Lua modules must be loaded
every time for each thread. For best results, use a thread pool.

### Environment

On Windows, the current directory is per thread! Same goes for env vars.
