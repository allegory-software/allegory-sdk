local jsmin = require'jsmin'

	JavaScript minification tool.

jsmin.minify(s) -> s

	Minify JavaScript string and return it as a string.
	Raises an error if JavaScript has basic syntax errors in it.

WARNING: JsMin is not a guaranteed-correct parser and it will fail on some
inputs, notably regex literals after which a newline is significant.
Because of that, and because the size of minified & gzipped js only goes down
about 30% of the gzipped size, jsmin is not enabled by default in webb.
